#MNIST Digit Classifier – Phase 1

This project is the first phase of a multi-stage machine learning project.  
The goal of this phase is to explore the **MNIST dataset**, perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and build a simple **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model using `scikit-learn`.

---

## Objectives
- Load and explore the MNIST dataset
- Visualize sample images
- Analyze class distribution (digits 0–9)
- Compute and visualize the mean image for each digit
- Preprocess the data (normalization and flattening)
- Train a KNN classifier with scikit-learn
- Evaluate the model with Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix
